# BBY Stealer Decompiled (Only for Maldev's)

## How i did it
1. i used Detect It Easy (by Horsicq) to identify the file type
2. then, i used Pkg Unpacker (by LockBlock-dev) to unpack the exe and retrieve the files inside the pkg exe
3. finally, i used View8 (by Suleram) to decompile the serialized V8 bytecode objects (JSC files)
